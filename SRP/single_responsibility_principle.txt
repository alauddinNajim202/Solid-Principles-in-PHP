Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
_____________________________________



Robert C. Martin Describe it:-

	A class should have one and only one reason to change , meaning that a
	class sould have only one Job


What is the Single Responsibility Principle?

So, what’s this SRP thing all about? Well, think of it like this: 
imagine you have a bunch of toys in your room. Each toy should have its own job, right? 
Like, a ball is for bouncing, and a teddy bear is for cuddling. In programming, 
the SRP says that each part of your code should have just one job to do. 
It’s like keeping your toys organized so you can find them easily when you need them!
